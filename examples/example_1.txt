Input (Selected product ID: B000SSYY88):
what kinds of cheese can this slicer handle?

Output:
This cheese slicer is designed to work effectively with medium to hard cheeses, such as cheddar, Gouda, Edam, and Swiss. Most customers found it performs well on firm cheeses and can create thin, even slices suitable for sandwiches or crackers. However, it struggles with soft cheeses like Brie or cream cheese, which tend to clog the slicer or turn mushy; soft cheeses may work better if chilled beforehand. For harder cheeses, the slicer is sturdy and reliable, offering consistent results. It's not adjustable for thickness, so expect thinner slices, though some users mention you could modify the bend for thicker cuts. If slicing soft cheese is a priority, you might want to consider a wire slicer, as that style handles softer cheeses better. Here are some follow-up questions you might consider: What is the slicer's performance like when cutting very hard cheeses, such as Parmesan?; Are there any particular techniques or tips to improve slicing softer cheeses with this product?; Does the slicer create consistent slice thickness, and can the thickness be adjusted?

Input (follow-up question in the same conversation):
what about brie?

Output:
This slicer is not recommended for Brie, even if it is chilled beforehand. While some customers suggest that chilling soft cheeses and dipping the slicer in water might improve results, the consensus is that this slicer works best with medium to hard cheeses. Many reviewers note that it struggles with soft cheeses, especially those like Brie, and can create a mushy mess or clog the slicer. For consistently clean slicing of Brie or other soft cheeses, a wire slicer would be more suitable, as it is specifically designed to handle softer textures effectively. Here are some follow-up questions you might consider: Have you considered what slice thickness you prefer and whether this slicer meets that need, especially for softer cheeses like Brie?; Would you be open to exploring a wire slicer instead if you frequently slice soft cheeses?; Do you want recommendations for maintaining or cleaning the slicer to ensure optimal performance, especially when used with soft cheeses?
